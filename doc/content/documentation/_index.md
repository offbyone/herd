Title: Documentation
---
This documentation covers the latest version of Herd. As herd has not yet reached 1.0, there are not
yet any guarantees of backwards compatibility. The `herd` cli tool tends to stay backwards
compatible, but the go API for creating providers and for embedding Herd as a library is not 100%
set in stone yet.

If you're just starting to use herd, head over to the [getting started](getting_started)
documentation. Once you have the basics working, the other parts of the documentation can be used as
a reference to make Herd do exactly what you want.

If you have a problem, suggestion or question, you can find the issue tracker for herd at
[GitHub](contributing).
