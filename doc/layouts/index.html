    <h1>Lightning-fast parallel ssh</h1>
    <p>
      Herd is a massively parallel ssh client that will replace all your
      hacky for loops, pssh, xargs and gnu parallel oneliners with something
      that is faster, more flexible and simply more awesome! Here is an
      example of herd in action, querying openssl package versions
      installed on all example.com servers.

    <p>
      While the hostnames in this example are obviously modified, the example
      itself is real. It queried almost 1500 servers in less than 20 seconds,
      over a relatively slow intercontinental VPN, intentionally limited to
      100 simultaneous connections due to this connectivity. Just imagine
      what you can do when running this inside your production environment!

    <h3><i class="fas fa-person-running"></i> Run at your speed</h3>
    You can make herd run as fast as you want. From setting global and
    per-host timeouts to limiting parallelism and making herd pause between
    hosts, herd will run at the speed you want and tell keep you informed
    of its progress. You can even change the speed on the fly!
  </div>
  <div class="col-4 p-4 float-left">
    <h3><i class="fas fa-stream"></i> Output what you want</h3>
    By default, herd shows you all output when it finished running a
    command everywhere. If you can't wait that long, it can output full results
    for each host as they come in. And if you like logs scrolling by, herd
    can output each line as it comes in. Color coding helps you spot errors
    quickly and when there's too much output, it automatically gets sent to a
    pager.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> Interactive shell</h3>
    Herd can also be run interactively, letting you quickly add/remove
    hosts from your active set and run commands on them. You can even use the
    results of commands as filters for your hostset.
  </div>
  <div class="col-4 p-4 float-left">
    <h3><i class="fas fa-file-code"></i> Reusable scripts</h3>
    The commands you use in the interactive shell can also be used as simple
    scripts for repeating tasks. Though if you find yourself writing such
    things, you may instead want to invest in proper configuration management
    and orchestration

  <div class="col-4 p-4 float-left">
    <h3><i class="fas fa-history"></i> Save your history</h3>
    Even when herd works at lightning speed, it's nice not to have to run
    commands multiple times. For this reason, herd stores all your history,
    including the output of commands. So if you just want to analyse this
    output a bit further, you can use tools like <a
    href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. <a
    href="https://jless.io/">jless</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/TomNomNom/gron">gron</a> to work with your history
    instead of running commands over and over again.
